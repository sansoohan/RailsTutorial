Fast Learning Ruby + Rails - SanSoo Han
===========================
Mimic This Project by yourself.<br>
If you don't like to cheet for some reason, go ahead and search some lecture in the Utube.<br>
But i recommend you to follow these steps at least.

<a href="https://github.com/sansoohan/Tutorials/tree/rails/Rails/01RubyTutorial" target="blank">01 - RubyTutorial</a>
--------------------
Don't waste your time for Ruby.<br>
Just Type and Feel it.<br>
Don't worry. It covers 95 percent of Ruby code.

<a href="https://github.com/sansoohan/Tutorials/tree/rails/Rails/02RubyChatServer" target="blank">02 - RubyChatServer</a>
---------------------
The First Step for server programing is making your own CHAT SERVER.<br>
You can understand What the server is with this under 100 Line of code.<br>
Pretty Easy huh?

<a href="https://github.com/sansoohan/Tutorials/tree/rails/Rails/03RubyGameServer" target="blank">03 - RubyGameServer</a>
----------------------
This is little Complicated. It is not just for chatting.<br>
You can understand How to programing the Server.<br>
Without this complexicy, You can't make MVC Well.

<a href="https://github.com/sansoohan/Tutorials/tree/rails/Rails/04RailsBootstrap" target="blank">04 - RailsBootstrap</a>
--------------------
You need to know how to split the template.<br>
You can make your own design. but you don't have any idea how to study it.<br>
Because of this reason, you need to understand BOOTSTRAP TEMPLATE first.<br>
You can learn how to get the gems for JS Library like jquery of bootstrap.

<a href="https://github.com/sansoohan/Tutorials/tree/rails/Rails/05RailsCRUD" target="blank">05 - RailsCRUD</a>
---------------------
If you are not familiar with Rails, Don't try to do fullstack first.<br>
It is not easy to do, all at once.<br>
Make View for Client First.(Tutorial 04)<br>
Then, make Model for Server.(Tutorial 05)<br>
You can architect database for GameServer either.

<a href="https://github.com/sansoohan/Tutorials/tree/rails/Rails/06RailsLogin" target="blank">06 - RailsLogin</a>
-----------------------
Model and View and Controller.<br>
Rails has MVC Pattern. And most of Server - Client Progaming has MVC.<br>
Some is architected by Component Pattern but, That is kind of MVC.<br>
You did V in the Lecture 4.<br>
You did M in the Lecture 5.<br>
Now you deal this C : Controller.<br>
Bring the server data and show it into client view.

<a href="https://github.com/sansoohan/Tutorials/tree/rails/Rails/07RailsGameFullStack" target="blank">07 - RailsGameFullstack</a>
--------------------------
You can make something Big Project now.<br>
Make Big something. Whatever you want.<br>
View And Contorller First without Model.<br>
You can make dummydata. Test the model with it.<br>
Everything works fine, Architect the Data Model.<br>
Finally, do Refactoring
